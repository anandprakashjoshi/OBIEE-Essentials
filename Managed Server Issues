1. Managed Server in an incompatible state

Most of the time when we start the managed server(in my case its bi_server) from weblogic 12c console,
we may encounter the following error

"bi_server1 is in an incompatible state"

One work around for this is we need to delete the managed_server.state file in the below location

$MiddlewareHome\user_projects\domains\domain_name\servers\managed_server\data\nodemanager

for me the path is 

C:\Middleware\user_projects\domains\bi\servers\bi_server1\data\nodemanager

and file name is

bi_server1.state
