Issue in starting managed server in weblogic,
It could be found that node manager is not reachable.

In this scenario we should first enroll the node manager to the domain through WLST

Go to the below location

/middlewarehome/wl_server_12.1/server/bin

setup the environment needed for WLST using the script setWLEnv.cmd
open WLST in interactive mode using the command java weblogic.WLST

connect('<USER_NAME>','PASSWORD','t3://localhost:9500')

It should show Admin server connected successfully

Now next step is to enroll the node manager to the domain using the below command

nmEnroll('<DOMAIN_HOME>','<NODE_MANAGER_HOME>')

note: In windows we need to use double slash ('\\') for the path

Now exit the WLST using the command exit()

Stop and Start node manager using stopNodeManager.cmd and startNodeManager.cmd
